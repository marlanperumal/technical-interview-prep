# Merge Intervals

- Problem: Given a collection of intervals, merge all overlapping intervals. For example, [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]] should become [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]].
- What it tests: Logic, handling edge cases, and sorting. It's a classic problem that's a good indicator of clean coding practices.
- Key concepts: Sorting arrays (`O(N \log N)$), iterating and comparing adjacent elements.
